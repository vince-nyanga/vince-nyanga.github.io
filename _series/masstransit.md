In this series I am going to showcase how to build a distributed system using MassTransit. I am going to start with a basic web API that does not use MassTransit, and then I will refactor it to use MassTransit, adding more features as we go along. These are the topics I will be covering:

- Part 1: Introducing HonesRemit _(coming soon)_
- Part 2: Introduction to MassTransit _(coming soon)_
- Part 3: Add MassTransit to HonesRemit _(coming soon)_
- Part 4: Understanding the MassTransit message pipeline _(coming soon)_
- Part 5: Implementing outbox pattern with MassTransit _(coming soon)_
- Part 6: Implementing saga pattern with MassTransit _(coming soon)_
- Part 7: Writing tests for MassTransit _(coming soon)_
- Part 8: MassTransit vs NServiceBus _(coming soon)_

All the code for this series can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/vince-nyanga/hones.remit.api). There will be a few branches that you can check out to see the progress. The `main` branch will always have the latest code.
