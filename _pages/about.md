## About Me

My name is Vincent Nyanga and I am a software developer based in Johannesburg, South Africa. I work predominantly as a backend developer using .NET, however, I do frontend work every now and then using Angular, as well as mobile development using Flutter. I am passionate about software development and technology in general. I am a certified [Microsoft Azure Developer Associate](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/68c8fc98-1478-44f7-b940-8e8348d7282b) and I am currently working towards becoming a Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect Expert.
