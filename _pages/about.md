I'm a software developer based in Johannesburg, South Africa, who enjoys working on anything software related particularly .NET, mobile apps using Flutter, as well as Machine Learning (still learning).

I believe in being a solid software developer first before specialising in different technologies. This foundation of software development principles gives me the ability to easily work with different technologies and programming languages.

## Projects

Whenever I get time I work on personal projects to try and learn something new and hone my skills as a software developer. Even though most of the projects don't see the light of day, I have a few that are live and doing relatively well out there. Below is a list of those projects were lucky enough to see the light of day.

### 1. RE 5 Made Easy

This is a mobile app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.vincenyanga.re5) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/re-5-made-easy/id1483182746) that helps users prepare for their Regulatory Exam (for representatives). The app is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), a UI toolkit by Google for bulding natively compiled applications for mobile, web and desktop from a single codebase. I learned Flutter during while I was working of the app and instantly fell in love with it.

### 2. RE 1 Made Easy

This is a mobile app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.vincentnyanga.re1) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/re-1-made-easy/id1494667167) that helps users prepare for their Regulatory Exam (for Key individuals). The apps were built using Flutter.

### 3. Hones.Kairos.Net

This is an open source client library for the [Kairos](https://www.kairos.com/) API. You may find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/vince-nyanga/Kairos.Net) and download the package from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hones.Kairos.Net).
