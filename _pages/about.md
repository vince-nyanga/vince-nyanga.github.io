I'm a software developer based in Johannesburg, South Africa. I enjoy working on anything software related particularly mobile app development, web development with Django and Flask as well as machine learning (still learning). 

## Projects
In my spare time I like to work on personal projects. Even though most of the projects don't see the light of day I have a few that are live and doing relatively well.

### RE 5 Made Easy
This is a mobile app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.vincenyanga.re5) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/re-5-made-easy/id1483182746) that helps users prepare for their Regulatory Exam (for representatives). The app is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), a UI toolkit by Google for bulding natively compiled applications for mobile, web and desktop from a single codebase.
