I'm a software developer based in Johannesburg, South Africa who enjoys working on anything software related particularly mobile app development, .NET, web development with Django and Flask as well as machine learning (still learning). 

## Projects
Whenever I get time I work on personal projects to try and learn something new and hone my skills as a software developer. Even though most of the projects don't see the light of day, I have a few that are live and doing relatively well out there. Below is a list of those  projects were lucky enough to see the light of day.

### 1. RE 5 Made Easy
This is a mobile app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.vincenyanga.re5) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/re-5-made-easy/id1483182746) that helps users prepare for their Regulatory Exam (for representatives). The app is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), a UI toolkit by Google for bulding natively compiled applications for mobile, web and desktop from a single codebase. I learned Flutter during while I was working of the app and instantly fell in love with it.
