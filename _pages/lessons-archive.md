My philosophy in life is to try and learn something new every day. I try to expand my knowledge in everything, and by everything I mean **everything**. This page will archive weekly summaries of things I learn from the courses I take, the people I interact with and material I read. It might not be updated on a weekly basis but I will try my best :smile:
